abstract = {The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology that enables high resolution detection of heterogeneities between cells. One important application of scRNA-seq data is to detect differential expression (DE) of genes. Currently, some researchers still use DE analysis methods developed for bulk RNA-Seq data on single-cell data, and some new methods for scRNA-seq data have also been developed. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data have different characteristics. A systematic evaluation of the two types of methods on scRNA-seq data is needed.},

abstract = {The sequencing of the transcriptomes of single-cells or single-cell RNA-sequencing has now become the dominant technology for the identification of novel cell types or the study of stochastic gene expression. In recent years, various tools for analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data have been proposed, many of them with the purpose of performing differentially expression analysis. In this work, we compare four different tools for single-cell RNA-sequencing differential expression, together with two popular methods originally developed for the analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data, but largely applied to single-cell data. We discuss results obtained in two real datasets and one synthetic dataset, along with considerations about the perspectives of single-cell differential expression analysis. In particular, we explore the methods performance in four different scenarios, mimicking different unimodal or bimodal distribution of the data, as characteristic of single-cell transcriptomics. We observe marked differences between the selected methods in terms of precision and recall, the number of detected differentially expressed genes and the overall performance. Globally, the results obtained in our study suggest that is difficult to identify a best performing tool and that efforts are needed to improve the methodologies for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis and gain better accuracy of results.},

abstract = {The development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at the single-cell level has already led to profound new discoveries in biology, ranging from the identification of novel cell types to the study of global patterns of stochastic gene expression. Alongside the technological breakthroughs that have facilitated the large-scale generation of single-cell transcriptomic data, it is important to consider the specific computational and analytical challenges that still have to be overcome. Although some tools for analysing RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be readily applied to single-cell RNA-seq data, many new computational strategies are required to fully exploit this data type and to enable a comprehensive yet detailed study of gene expression at the single-cell level.},
