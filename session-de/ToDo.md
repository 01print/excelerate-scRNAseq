ToDo
================

General: 
- discuss all the parts on how to improve
- go through material, rewrite, shorten/expand, modify where needed
- find Seurat dataset
- test and improve coding blocks to run with Seurat dataset
- prepare .tmp and results files for students to access when they struggle
- find a solution to store .tmp and results files
- include advanced exercises
- include some mini quizes /expandable sections

Intro session:
- rethink and upadate Menti, maybe use google forms instead
- add live-coding demo at the end, e.g. metrics of the matrix
- improve distribution example plot

Other session:
- include missing data imputation methods (wrap-up session)?
- include some data simulation for assessing methods performance (methods evaluation)?
